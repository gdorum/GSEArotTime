\title{Restricted maximum likelihood to estimate the covariance matrix of longitudinal expression data with gene dependencies within gene sets and correlation between samples}
\usage{
reml_genedep(alphaStart, Xlist, Ylist, Zlist, TsList, GsList, BsList, A, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{alphaStart}{A numeric vector of start values for the parameters to be estimated. The first parameter must be gene variance, the second parameter random error 
variance, the third must be a parameter controlling correlation between time points and the fourth must be a parameter controlling correlation between genes. 
The remaining parameters can be variances for other random design factors.}

\item{Xlist}{Design matrix with fixed design variables for a gene set (assuming same design for all gene sets)}

\item{Ylist}{vector of observed values for all gene sets}

\item{Zlist}{Design matrix for random design factors for a gene set (assuming same design for all gene sets)}

\item{TsList}{Structure of time dependencies between samples in a gene set (assuming same design for all gene sets)}

\item{GsList}{Structure of gene dependencies between samples in a gene set (assuming same design for all gene sets)}

\item{BsList}{(Optional) structure of batch dependencies between samples in a gene set (assuming same design for all gene sets)}

\item{A}{Restrictions for parameters. See \code{\link{constrOptim}}}

\item{b}{Restrictions for parameters. See \code{\link{constrOptim}}}
}
\value{
\item{alpha.hat }{Vector of estimates for the parameters in alphaStart}
\item{beta.hat }{Vector of estimated parameters for fixed design factors}
\item{sigma }{Estimated common variance}
\item{maxlik }{The maximum likelihood value}
}
\description{
Restricted maximum likelihood for longitudinal expression data where genes are assumed correlated within gene set and uncorrelated between different gene sets. 
All genes within the same gene set are assumed to have identical covariance matrix. The gene sets may differ in size and hence have different covariance matrix.
